Macroeconomics Policy and Practice 
Frederic S. Mishkin 2nd Edition

## Why Learn Macro Econ
- Father of modern economics
	- Adam Smith
- Proposes "**invisible hand**"
	- The reason why people are doing things in this economy, they are doing is because they are trying to fulfill their own self-interest
	- People are working for each other
- "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their interest." - Adam Smith

- Is the free market efficient?
- Severe recessions and crises in the early 1900s
- New Economics thoughts

### John M. Keynes
- Founder of modern Macroeconomics
- "Capitalism is the astounding belief that the wickedest of men will do the wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone"
- "The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones"
How should the government regulate big corporations?

## Measuring Economic Performance
Q: How can we measure "economic performance"
- Many different elements
	- Employment and unemployment(**How long it takes on average to find a job**)
	- income or expenditure (**How much are people are earning and spending**)
	- production (**How much stuff the economy is producing**)

- Begin to look at the total production (or total output)
	- The total value of all goods and services produced in an economy over a fixed time period
	- this measure is called **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
### GDP has been increasing over the 1947 - 2017 time period 
- There have been a couple of wiggles
- and a blip in 2009-10 following a financial crisis
### Why has the GDP grown during this period
- The population has grown (more people = more output)
- Prices have increased (inflation)
- productivity has increased (each person can produce more)
### Let's divide the GDP by the population per year
- The **GDP per person** has changed so much over time 

### The picture is similar, but now 
- the numbers on the vertical axis are easier to interpret
- The wiggles are slightly 

## Nominal GDP vs Real GDP
- So far we have measured **nominal GDP**
	- Goods and services valued at current market prices
	- nominal GDP in 2010 is calculated using prices from 2010
	- nominal GDP in 2017 is calculated using prices from 2017
- The solution is to use **Real GDP**
	- value all goods and services produced in different years using the same prices

## Is higher GDP necessarily better?
- No Counterexamples:
	- Production that causes high levels of pollution
	- leisure is not counted in the GDP
	- many others
- Why do we talk so much about GDP
	- it is a useful indicator (but not an objective)

### It is a very useful indicator
- Suppose we measure well-being by looking at:
	- Consumption, leisure, mortality, inequality 
- The result is highly correlated with real GDP per capita

### Growth Rates and Log Scales
- Suppose an economy grows at a constant rate (2%) every year
	- start with the real GDP per capita of 100 (= y0)
	- y1 = y0 x 1.02 = 102
	- y2 = y1 x 1.02 = y0(1.02)^2 = 104.04
	- y3 = y2 x 1.02 = y0(1.02)^3 = 106.12
	- ...
	- yt = y0(1.02)^t
		- Exponential Growth

- What happens if we graph log(y)?

### Returning to our questions
- How well has the US economy performed since 2010
	- What factors have hindered the economy in this period?
	- What factors have helped?
	- Have the Federal Reserve's policies been effective?
	- Would infrastructure spending have macroeconomic benefits?
- It is easy to add more questions to this list
	- will the US economy return to the long-run trend?
- We can ask similar questions about other countries

### More Questions
- Why is the gap between the top and bottom so large?
- Why are some countries moving up in the distribution?
	- ... and why are others moving down?
- Why is the trend non-linear in many countries?
	- examples: Japan, China, India
	- what does this tell us about the force underlying growth?
- Will growth in China and India slow down?
