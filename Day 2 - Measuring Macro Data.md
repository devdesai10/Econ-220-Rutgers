1. Measuring Output
	 - three approaches to measure GDP
	 - nominal vs. real GDP
2. Measuring Inflation
3. Measuring labor market activity
	- three key measures
	- the dynamics of unemployment
	- the natural rate of unemploymen

# Motivation
- Last time: measuring Output is an essential first step for answering many macro questions
- Example: assessing the effects of the 2008-9 crisis
	- need to know what the pre-crisis trend was
	- and how far below that trend we are now
	- need to be able to measure output and compare values over time
# National Income Accounting
- Today we take data like GDP for granted
- Policy makers in 1930 had **much** less information
	- could not accurately measure the size of the downturn
- Lead the development of *National Income Accounting*
	- "One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century" (Samuelson and Nordhaus)

- How would you measure total US output in 2023?
- Leave aside practical considerations for a moment
	- Conceptually, what do we mean by "total output"?
- Let's begin with a simple example

# A simple economy
- Imagine a world with only apples and bananas
	- Production in a given year
	![[Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10.37.37 AM.jpg]]
- Which economy produced more output?
	- Answer depends on how one values apples relative to bananas
	- How should we assign values?

- Suppose the market prices are:
	![[Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 10.39.14 AM.jpg]]
- Then GDP in each economy is:
	- Economy A: 100 x $2 + 200 x $1 = $400
	- Economy B: 200 x $2 + 100 x $1 = $500
- this is called the *production approach*
	- add up the market value of all goods produced
# Definition
- *Gross Domestic Product* (GDP) is:
	- Current **market value** of all **final** goods and services **newly** produced in the economy during a fixed period of time
Q: How could we measure this in practice?
- ask all firms to report their total sales for the year?

- Measure by summing **Value Added** across all firms
	- **Value Added** = firm's output minus the cost of **intermediate goods**

# How much does each increase 2017 GDP
- You buy a 5-year old car from your neighbor for $8,000
	- **ZERO**
- You buy a 5-year old car from a dealership for $10,000
	- Suppose the dealer bought the car at auction for $8,000
	- **$2,000**
- A new car worth $20,000 is produced in 2017, but not sold
	- **$20,000**
- A firm produces $100,000 of machinery that will installed in a factory and used to produce goods in future years
	- $100,000
- You buy $1,000 worth of share in apple
	- using E-trade, which charges you a commission of $6.99
	- **$6.99**
- A drug company spends $10 million in 2017 to develop a new drug
	- Sells $11 million worth of drug to consumer in 2017
	- cost of production: $ 1 million
	- This one is tricky
	- **$21 million**

# GDP = market value of all *final* goods and services
Q: is the invention a final good?
- Prior to 2013, answer was no
	- Only the medicine sold to consumers was a final good
	- Contribution to GDP is $11 million
- New rules adopted in July 2013 
	- The invention of the drug itself is also a final good
		- Like a machine, it will generate benefits in future years
	- Contribution to GDP is **$21 Million**

- Similar changes made for "entertainment, literary, and artistic originals"
- Result: GDP became about 3% larger
	- Revisions made back to 1929
- Point of this example:
	- the idea of GDP is conceptually clear, but...
	- there are always grey areas
	- results: definition, accounting rules evolve over time
# Double (and Triple) checking
- In practice, measuring GDP using the production approach is difficult
	- would like to check the validity of the resulting numbers
	- we can also measure GDP indirectly using ...
- Fundamental identity of national income accounting:
	- **Total Production = Total Expenditure = Total Income**
		- roughly: everything that is *produced* is *purchased* by someone, and is also *sold* by someone
# expenditure approach
**Total Production = Total Expenditure** = Total Income

- GDP = total *spending* on currently produced final goods and services in the economy
- **National Income Identity**:
	- Y = C + I + G + NX
	- where:
		- Y = GDP + total production (output)
		- C = Consumption Expenditure
		- I = Investment
		- G = Government purchases of goods & services

# What if some apples are not sold?
- Inventories of apples would increase
	- This would be included in I (investment)

# The Income Approach
- Idea: add all of the income recieved by households and firms, including profits and taxes
Types of Income:
- Compensation of employees
- Corporate Profits
- Other income (self-employed, royalties, net interest)
**Sum of these is *National Income***

1. National Income + Depreciation = Gross National Product (GNP)
- Depreciation = the loss of value of capital from wear and tear
Q: Why do we add this to income?
2. GNP - net factor income = GDP
- Net factor income = wages, profits, and rent paid to US residents by foreigners minus the revers
	- Generally a positive number for the US
# Income Approach to GDP, 2017

Profit = Revenue - Wages
		-Cost of Intermediate Goods
		-Cost of replacing machines
		**Depreciation**

profit + wages + depreciation = revenue - cost of intermediate goods
