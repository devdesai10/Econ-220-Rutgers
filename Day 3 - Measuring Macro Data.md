# Nominal vs. Real GDP
- So far we have measured **nominal** GDP
	- Goods and services valued at *current* market prices
- Comparing 2017 with 2016, two things have changed:
	- The quantities of goods and services produced, and
	- current market prices
- How much of the increase in GDP is due to higher production (rather than higher prices)?
	- How can we compare *real* output over time
	- idea: **hold prices fixed**
